I'll start with the defaults here,

- 👋 Hi, I’m Abraham Ezequiel Chalave.
- 👀 I’m interested in highly performant code, FOSS and open hardware.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the C family (C, C++ and C#), I did a lot of scripting before.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, mostly as a hobby, or anything new and disrupting (e.g.: DOTS/ECS).
- 📫 How to reach me: abraham.chalave@gmail.com, abraham.chalave@outlook.com

In case you haven't checked for my other [repos](https://github.com/wooobotch?tab=repositories), [blogs](https://wooobotch.github.io/) or this is your first time reading about me:

- I'm a teacher[^1], not so long ago I moved to web development and then to DevOps.
- I took some management and coaching lessons to merge my two backgrounds (education and technology).
- If you meet me IRL you can tell I'm not fashion driven.
- Countryside > cities.
- *Reclaim your desktop*
- Magic (TCG), Diablo I and II, Age of Empires (the first one), DoTA 2 and languages are my hobbies.
- Many more things![^2]
